# exoMod
A mod for Rimworld PC game.

Roadmap (for now) :

 => new jobs categorization (less categories, more efficiency)

 => better wall constructions so that no pawn will be stupidly blocked in the room he just finsished
 
 => better cleaning jobs : cleaners will perform the job smarter (high prioirity zones, whole room cleaning) 
 
 => social interactions big improvements :  
 
    - each pawn will have its own emotional structure, based on the OCEAN personality model and a new set of emotions
    
    - a pawn will can force another to do somethings.. which could be refused
    
    - many over cool stuff
